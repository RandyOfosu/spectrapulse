### **Hi there** ðŸ‘‹
I'm **[Tyrone Faulhaber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/spectrapulse/)** ([Spectrapulse](https://spectrapul.se)) and I'm a Student Software Engineer from [The Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands).

** **
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on nothing in particular. I'm thinking of writing a public [Discord](https://discord.com) bot though!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and trying out different [Python](https://python.org) workflows.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything. If I know to help out I probably will if I'm not too busy.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything Linux related and I'll most likely be able to help you! It's in my blood :)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [You may want to take a look here.](https://keybase.io/spectrapulse)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him, they/them
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love creating things, if it isn't software it is probably something hardware related. I strive for perfection!
